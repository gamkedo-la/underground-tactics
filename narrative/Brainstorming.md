how does the party grow?  Maybe captured players that are freed then join the party?

Intro story and maybe after certain milestones?  Some dialog between player/enemies?

### How does player discover goal?
##### Party Splitting:
- Player introduced to full team in initial encounter 
- Party split after encounter resolves
- Wizard PC notes risk of being solo with partially expended resources in unknown area
- Wizard PC wants to find party for safety
- Player begins exploring to fulfill PC's need for safety
##### NPC Encounters:
- Combat:
	- Player discovers rooms full of enemies
	- Enemies are initially preoccupied before encounters begin
	- Enemy dialogue highlights PC presence as disruptive
	- Enemy sees PCs as threats to major plans
	- Enemies eventually are potentially on high alert based on player action
	- Player decides how to deal with discovered threats after piecing together narrative
- Neutral:
	- Trading with NPCs
	- Gaining info from NPC dialogue
	- Side quests
- Friendly:
	- Aid player
	- Give resources
	- Give tips/valuable info
- Changing NPC disposition (friendly/neutral/hostile)
##### Unique Interactions:
- Player discovers items that allow for unique environment/NPC interactions:


### Narrative Meaning for Rules
##### Rules
- Combat Rules
	- Characters are limited in movement/athletic actions based on Stamina points and action cost
		- Athletics-based classes have lower stamina action costs and higher stamina point pools that allow a short range of movement with a high costing ability, a moderate range of movement with a moderate costing ability, or a wider range of movement with a low costing/no ability use.
	- Characters are limited in spells/magical actions/enchanted item use based on magic points and action cost
		- Magic-based classes have lower magic action costs and higher magic point pools that allow for stronger magical abilities/spells/items to be used and spell use on consecutive turns without recouping magic points
	- Characters can only take (up to) one movement and one non-movement action per turn
		- Certain skills/items can generate reactions allowing for extra ability use per turn
	- Ability cost depends on character stats and strength of power/utility of said action
	- Player characters can exit combat encounters by one character exiting 
	- When a character loses all their HP that character dies permanently
- Interaction Rules
	- Combat encounters start when non-hidden PC enters encounter range for hostile NPCs
	- Neutral/friendly NPCs without urgent dialogue will wait for PC interaction
	- Neutral/friendly NPCs with urgent dialogue will initiate interaction with PC
	- Unique combat encounters begin with dialogue that affects encounter/narrative
	- Certain hostile enemies will wait to ambush PCs
		- PCs can notice ambushes and reverse surprise rounds
- Environment Rules
	- Character Movement happens independently on each character's turn
		- Characters can flee by exiting enemy "leash range" or escaping the current room through designated evacuation zones
	- Trap encounters:
	- Puzzle encounters:
	- Hidden item encounters:
	- Secret passage encounters:
	- Locked passage/storage encounters:
- Item Rules
	- Consumables have set amount of uses and disappear after that number is reached

### Characters as Goals, Resources, and Conflict

###### Goal Characters:
- PCs to reunite/rejoin party
###### Resource Characters:
- PCs that allow player to interact with world
- Friendly/neutral NPCs
- Unique interaction NPCs

###### Conflict Characters:
- Enemy NPCs
- PCs with differing opinions on player actions
- Neutral NPCs with conflicting interests to party (?)

### Connection Between Story Events and Player Actions

- Build narrative bottlenecks in pairs that allow for player choice
	- Things that must happen will happen (just in different ways)

[[Brainstorming#NPC Encounters|Player engaging in NPC interactions alters story]]
[[Brainstorming#Party Splitting|Player decides which party members to expend resources recruiting]]
[[Brainstorming#Player discovers items that allow for unique environment/NPC interactions|Player action brings unique environment/NPC interactions]]
- Limited resources make players choose what unique interactions to engage with or to save resources for personal use
[[Brainstorming#Goal|Player chooses how to navigate completing game narrative through character actions]]
