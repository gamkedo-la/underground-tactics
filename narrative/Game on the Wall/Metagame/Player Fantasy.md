> The player controls a well-oiled machine of a party that works together to rescue each other while uncovering the sinister plot of a covert evil. **(Cooperation)**
> 
> - Each party member is tied to a separate mechanic that they are required for. (ex: Rogue for Traps, Wizard for Arcane Puzzles)
> - In-combat Team actions/tactics (ex: flanking, halfling toss, etc)

> After a catastrophe caused by in-fighting splits the party, the player must choose between their allies and deal with the consequences **(Opposition)**
> 
> - Player is introduced to an expanded party (10 characters) that they will have to choose between
> - Choices are a trade-off where you get the advantage one character has while dealing with combat, traps, etc resulting from the choice

> The player must navigate inter-party dynamics to regrow party bonds after the starting PC causes an incident that splits the party. Their bonds make them stronger. **(Reconciliation)**
> 
> - Party bonds create unique interactions between party members in and out of combat (ex: Lovers get a free out of combat heal, Rivals can motivate or taunt each other in combat for a buff to both or a bigger buff to the taunter and a debuff to the target, friends can intercept/share damage if they are within range, etc)
> - Character relationships can extend to some NPCs as well for specific benefits (items, info, etc)
